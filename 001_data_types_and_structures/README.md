# Day One - Basic Data Types

## Intro
	So today I will be learning the basic data types in Python.
	I assume you already know the concept of programming and what is all about.
	In case you don't, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyv4IcqG2OA "What is Programmming by blondiebytes") to a Youtube Video explain all that.

## Topics  
	- Integers, floats, and complex numbers
	- Strings and string manipulation
	- Booleans
	- None type

### What are data types?
	Well we know data is unused information or information without meaning. 
	So data types in programming are the various forms of data that determing how the programming language manipulates it to give information.
	The various data types are assigned to varaibles, this is like a box with a label on it to make retrieval or manipulation of that data easier.
	Let's say we wanted to perform a calculation using the value of Pi to it's 60th place. 
	It won't make sense to type all sixty digits every time we want to add or substract from it, so we can store that data into a variable named `Pi`
	and whenever we want to subtract a number from it, we can just go: `Pi - 2`. So below are the data types used in Python.

### Intergers
	These are whole numbers basically. Can be either negative or positive e.g 1, -3, 400, 0, -32 etc.

### Floats
	Floats are numbers with decimal points. e.g 2.5, -4.0, 3.142, 99.99 etc.

### Complex numbers
	These are imaginary numbers they're expressed in python like: `(3,43)`, `(14, 20)` to represent 3i+43j and 14i+20j.

### Strings and string manipulatons
	Strings are basically text (alphabets, numbers and even symbols) so howdo you differentiate between a string of numbers and an actual number?
	well strings must be wrapped in quotes, either a single quote like `'string'` or double quote like `"string"` or back-ticks like ``string``.

### Booleans
	Booleans are use in programming conditions. We have two types of Booleans which are `True` and `False`.

### None type
	This is kind of confusing but None type with Python syntax as `None` represents nothing. It is different from `null` which represents emptiness. 
	For example lets say we have a box, if that box where to have 2 items in it we'd say the number of contents in the box is 2, 
	if there wher no items we'd  would assign `null` to that box. But if there was no box to begin with then that is `None`. Its a very abstract concept but
	I will show you its application.

## Challenge
- Play around with all the data types listed
